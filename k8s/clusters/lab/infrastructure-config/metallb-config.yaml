# L2 Advertisement: Announce LoadBalancer IPs via ARP on macvlan interface
# L2 mode is designed for same-subnet clients (VMs/containers on bridge0)
# Use macvlan interface (metallb0) attached to bridge0 with unique MAC
# This avoids MAC address conflict with bridge0 itself (22:c4:a4:e0:6d:fc)
# and allows VMs on vnet1 and network clients through eno1 to reach services
